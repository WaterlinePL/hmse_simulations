# HMSE - simulations submodule

This repository stores submodule used in [HMSE-frontend](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/HMSE-frontend) to create 
simulation pipeline. There are three branches, one for each deployment:
* [`desktop`](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/hmse_simulations/tree/desktop)
* [`docker`](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/hmse_simulations/tree/docker)
* [`k8s`](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/hmse_simulations/tree/k8s)


### Main branch
The [`main`](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/hmse_simulations/tree/main) branch is used as an interface for all the 
deployments and stores common code used by other branches.
