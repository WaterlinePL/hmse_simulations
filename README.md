# HMSE - simulations submodule

This repository stores submodule used in [HMSE-frontend](https://github.com/WaterlinePL/HMSE-frontend) to create simulation pipeline. There are three deployment branches:
* `desktop`
* `docker`
* `k8s`

Each of these are used in the related branch on the frontend.

### Main branch
The main branch is used as an interface for all the deployments and stores common code used by other branches.
